Server side script consists of all the logical part of the project which includes Dijikstra's Algorithm to get the shortest path inreal-time, NOSQL Database such as MongoDB to store and access the data(formatted or unformatted both) on user demand and other logical parts..
I also have used Sockek Programming for client and server communication

## Getting Started
